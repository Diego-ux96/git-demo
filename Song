Only God Can Judge Me (feat. Rappin' 4-Tay)
Only God can judge me, is that right?
Only God can judge me now
Only God, baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
